# Pathfinding_With_Evolutionary_Agents

### Implementation and evaluation of simple evolutionary agents for path finding in 2D environments

#### Description
Several popular metaheuristics, including ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization, employ swarm intelligence (SI) to find solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. For example, ACO uses a collection of simple agents, communicating via so-called pheromones, to search for shortest paths in unknown environments. The purpose of this bachelor project is to implement, visualise and evaluate collections of simple evolutionary or swarm intelligence agents for the solution of path finding problems in well-defined environments on a 2D plane. In detail, the following aspects will be studied:

- literature research on the relevant type of SI algorithms, in particular ACO, and related results on their performance for path finding in 2D environments,

- design, implementation and empirical analysis of SI agents in a flexible 2D-environments allowing for maze structures, which may change dynamically,

- design, implementation and empirical analysis of overarching optimization problems (like path finding) for the collection of agents,

- design and implementation of a graphical user interface that allows to define the environment and agents and to visualize the solution process,

- design, implementation and empirical analysis of fitness functions giving the agents different signals with respect to the current level of achievement of the overarching goal of optimization,

- design and implementation of benchmark problems with a clear progression of difficulty to be solved by the agents,

- design and integration of different levels of complexity into the agents (e.g., different speeds of movement, speeds of adaptation, modes of communication, levels of interaction) and the environment (e.g., via checkpoints representing sub-goals and light effects and other signals),

- Documentation of the project in a concise report, which is defended orally.
